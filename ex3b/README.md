# Project Overview

This repository contains several C programming projects, including implementations of a **Snakes and Ladders** game, a **Markov Chain**, and various utility functions such as **Linked List** operations and a **Tweet Generator**.

## Project Structure

### 1. **Snakes and Ladders**
   - **Files:**
     - `snakes_and_ladders.c`: The main implementation file for the Snakes and Ladders game.
     - `snakes_and_ladders.o`: Compiled object file for the game.
     - `snake`: The executable file to run the game.

   - **Description:**
     This project simulates the classic board game Snakes and Ladders. It uses a text-based interface and operates via command-line input.

   - **How to Run:**
     1. Compile using the provided `makefile`.
     2. Run the `snake` executable to start the game.

### 2. **Tweet Generator (Markov Chain)**
   - **Files:**
     - `tweets_generator.c`: This file contains the logic to generate random tweets using a Markov chain model.
     - `markov_chain.c`: Contains the implementation of the Markov chain data structure.
     - `markov_chain.h`: The header file for the Markov chain functions.

   - **Description:**
     This project uses a Markov chain to generate random tweets based on an input dataset of previous tweets or text samples. The Markov chain creates coherent sentences by analyzing the transition probabilities of words.

   - **How to Run:**
     1. Ensure all dependencies (Markov Chain, Linked List) are compiled.
     2. Use the provided `makefile` to compile the tweet generator.
     3. Run the executable generated to see random tweets.

### 3. **Linked List Utility**
   - **Files:**
     - `linked_list.c`: Implements basic linked list operations such as insertion, deletion, and traversal.
     - `linked_list.h`: The header file for the linked list functions.

   - **Description:**
     This is a general-purpose linked list module that can be reused across different projects. It provides essential linked list operations, including memory management, node creation, and more.

### 4. **General Functions**
   - **Files:**
     - `important_function_general.c`: Contains general-purpose functions used across the projects. These could be utility functions or common algorithms used in multiple components.

   - **Description:**
     This file houses a collection of important functions used to support other modules and logic across the projects. 

### 5. **Build Instructions**
   - **File:**
     - `makefile`: The makefile automates the compilation of the various projects in the repository.

   - **Usage:**
     1. Navigate to the root directory of the repository.
     2. Run the following command to compile all projects:
        ```bash
        make
        ```
     3. The appropriate executables (such as the Snakes and Ladders game or Tweet Generator) will be generated.

## Dependencies

- **C Compiler**: You need a C compiler such as `gcc` to compile the code.
- **Make**: The provided `makefile` should be used to handle the compilation of the code.

## How to Use

1. Clone the repository to your local machine.
2. Navigate to the root directory of the project.
3. Compile the necessary modules using the `makefile`.
4. Run the desired executable (e.g., `snake` for Snakes and Ladders, or the Tweet Generator executable).
